<h1>My Reading Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Bianca Zanotti</h2>
</header>

<p><br>Hi my name is Bianca Zanotti, I am a 9th grader at Avenues São Paulo and this is my reading portfolio 
I think this is more like a reading blog but reading portfolio sounds way more professional so I'll keep that. Here I will be keeping track of the books I read, audiobooks and even podcasts I listen through out the school year (2020-2021), what I think about them and how they impacted me. This website will be updated every month.</p>

<h2><br>Reading Goal</h2>
<p>My reading goal is to read between 30-40 minutes per day. I also want to have a variety of genres and formats. In order to achieve that, I will use my 9th grade hour (that is basically a free time) to read.</p>

<h3 class="everyday">Every day</h3>
<h4 class="everyday">By David Levithan<h4>
<p class="everyday">I decided to start with this book because it meant a lot to me in my journey as a reader.<br>Back in 2019 in English class, my teacher read some pages from this book and I've been wanting to read it since then. Even though I wanted to read the book, laziness had caught me. And between us, I'm not a big fan of reading.<br>I decided to play Uno's "reverse" card and start reading the book. From now on, I am not the lazy girl that hates reading. Don't tell anyone this but I actually enjoyed reading this book.<br>I believe that my main takeaway from this book is not related with its story, but actually to creating a reading habit that, hopefully, I can continue to have and get better and better.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<h4>By J.K. Rowling<h4>
<p class="special" style="padding-right:450px;">The story behind why I decided to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not as inspiring as the previous book I read, it is actually pretty simple.<br>It all began when I was normally scrolling through Tik Tok and realised that all of the videos recommended to me were about Harry Potter and how everybody had a crush on Draco Malfoy. The first thought I had was: "Well, I must be missing something." and then I remembered what my sister tells me basically every day: "You NEED to read Harry Potter!!! The books are SO much better than the movies!". So I decided to read the books.<br>I really enjoyed reading this book. Before this reading, if I had a book to read that the movie had already released, I would choose to watch the movie. But now I realised why literally everybody says that the books are usually better than the movies, they are way more descriptive and even if you watched the movie, there are a lot more scenes in the book that are not used when the movie is being produced.</p>

<h3 class="everyday">Cartas na mesa</h3>
<h4 class="everyday">By Agatha Christie<h4>
<p class="everyday">The reason why I chose to read this book is because in the past, I've read some books of the same author and really enjoyed it. This mystery is basically about a murder that happened during a Bridget play and there are four main suspect.<br>I was pretty disappointed with this book because I spent a lot of time and effort reading it and the end was really bad. It gave me the feeling that I waste my time on nothing worthy. That's why I think this reflection is way shorter than the others.<br>I believe that my main takeaway from this book was understanding how to deal with frustration, especially when the end is not something I expect.</p>

<h3>As vantagens de ser invisível</h3>
<h4>By Stephen Chbosky<h4>
<p class="special" style="padding-right:450px;">Eu irei escrever minha reflexão deste livro em português porque como irei apresentar muitas passagens do livro, que foi escrito em português, ficará mais fácil de entender.<br>Acredito que esse tenha sido um dos melhores livros que eu li até agora, recomendo a leitura. É possível simpatizar com o personagem principal, que também é o narrador, ao longo do livro inteiro. A rica descrição de seus pensamentos torna possível a compreensão de seus sentimentos.<br>Assim que acabei de ler, fui assistir o filme. Porém eu achei o livro muito melhor. Os atores são ótimos mas o livro parecia mais real. Não sei como explicar. Quando eu li Harry Potter, eu já sabia como os personagens eram, por isso não tive a chance de imaginar, mas quando fui ver o filme tive uma surpresa.<br>Uma passagem que achei muito significante é: "A gente aceita o amor que acha que merece.". Ainda não sei explicar o porque, mas acho que faz muito sentido.</p>

<h3 class="everyday">Pequeno Manual Antirrasista</h3>
<h4 class="everyday">By Djamila Ribeiro<h4>
<p class="everyday">Eu irei escrever minha reflexão deste livro em português porque como irei apresentar algumas passagens do livro, que foi escrito em português, ficará mais fácil de entender.<br>Decidi ler esse livro porque racismo e desigualdade racial foram tópicos no debate da aula de Global Mindset que me interessaram muito.<br>Esse livro me ajudou a entender como eu, uma mulher branca, posso contribuir na luta contra o racismo. Escolhi algumas passagens do livro que eu me relacionei e me fizeram refletir, a primeira passagem é essa: "Pessoas brancas não costumam pensar sobre o que significa pertencer a esse grupo, pois o debate racial é sempre focado na negritude." A segunda passagem é essa: "Não se trata de se sentir culpado por ser branco: a questão é se responsabilizar. Diferente da culpa, que leva à inércia, a responsabilidade leva à ação. Dessa forma, se o primeiro passo é desnaturalizar o olhar condicionado pelo racismo, o segundo é criar espaços, sobretudo em lugares que pessoas negras não costumam acessar."</p>

<h3 class="everyday">Skinny Dipping: The Body & Radical Self Love</h3>
<h4 class="everyday">By Tatiana Ringsby and Kela Rose<h4>
<p class="everyday">I started listening to Skinny Dipping because one of the hosts of the podcast is an influencer on Tik Tok that I follow for a log time. They talk about some subjects that might be classified as tabu and controversial, sharing personal experiences and other things. In this specific episode, The Body & Radical Self Love, they talk about the concepts of body positivity vs body neutrality, recovering from eating disorders and radical self love.<br>My main take away from this podcast is what body neutrality is, in a more spiritual way, and start applying that in my daily life. The concept is basically knowing that our body is a vessel for our soul and appreciate what it can do to us. Rather analysing what it looks like and put yourself down because of societal standards for a pretty body, appreciate what your body does to you every day."</p>

<h2 class="third"><br> Short Stories</h2>

<h3>The Glass Tower</h3>
<h4>By Reinaldo Arenas<h4>
<p class="special">"The Glass Tower" (Reinaldo Arenas, 1986) is a short story from Cuba about a writer called Alfredo. He goes to a party concerning his new publishing house, many guests attend his party, and Alfredo gets distracted when the characters from his story start appearing outside the building. The characters enter the building and cause trouble for Alfredo. Eventually, everyone leaves and peculiar things happen at the end leaving Alfredo confused and lost. <br>The main (im)moral subject addressed in this story is if he should go to these parties or indulge in his craving and need to write. In the quote, "At that moment, as the diva's note reached a crescendo, he grabbed a napkin in flight and began desperately to scribble some notes." (Arenas, 1986), we can see how he was feeling so pressured that he needed to write.<br>I believe that the main idea of the text is the oppression of society, in the short story, Reinaldo Arenas wrote about the pressure the characters were putting into him and how it contrasts with what the guests wanted from him. I think the text may have a relationship with his personal life in terms of oppression and society. He was oppressed in Cuba because of his sexuality and writing. In the 70s, he was imprisoned because he was openly gay, he had to escape to the US to publish a manuscript that was confiscated by the Cuban Government and in 1990, while suffering from AIDs, arenas committed suicide. (Britannica, 2020). Nowadays, being LGBT is legal and people have the right to change legal gender in Cuba, however, same sex marriage is not recognised.</p>

<h3><br>Who, Me a Bum?</h3>
<h4>By Luisa Valenzuela<h4>
<p class="special">One quote from this short story that impacted me is: "They've pushed me out in the street: good-by to food that's awful but regular, good-by to a flea-ridden blanket but a blanket nonetheless. Back to seeing where I can get a little dough for eats, back to the daily grind, to this city that's more and more impossible, where I can't even get in a little morning snooze because 8:37 a.m. suicide comes then and interferes with my rest."<br>According to the  National Statistics and Census of the Republic of Argentina, up to 5 million people are homeless (approximately 10 percent of the overall population) I believe the author of this short story decided to tell the story of a homeless guy in Argentina because he is not the only homeless person and it is a social issue there.</p>

<h3><br>Night Woman</h3>
<h4>Edwidge Danticat<h4>
<p class="special">Some subjects addressed in this story that really interested me are poverty and prostitution. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Over six million Haitians live in poverty and 2 millions and a half live in extreme poverty. That is why they often turn to prostitution. (The World Bank, 2020).<br>We can see in the following quote an example of why prostitution can be a (im)moral subject in the text "Night Woman". "Most nights, I hear a slight whisper. My body freezes as I wonder how long it would take for him to cross the curtain and find me. He says, "Mommy." I say, "Darling" Somehow in the night, he always calls me in whispers. I hear the buzz of his transistor radio. It is shaped like a can of cola. One of my suitors gave it to him to plug into his ears so he can stay asleep while Mommy works." (Edwidge, Danticat, 1996).<br>This is a quote that shows (im)moral behaviour and how it is a product of culture and society because Haiti is influenced by Catholicism, this religion don't face prostitution very well. The Pope Francis said that he is sorry for all the Catholics that committed this crime. A big influence like the Pope influences people to think like him, that prostitution is a crime. And in my interpretation of the story this is why the Night Woman is so afraid one day her son will find out the truth.<br></p>

<h3>Ethics of War</h3>
<h4>An article from ABC­CLIO's Issues website<h4>
<p class="special">This is an article about ethics of war that I read while doing an assignment for the project Caution! Radioactive Society. This article helped me to understand better what is ethics of war and answering and reflecting on the question: How can a war be ethical?<br>After reading the article carefully, my perception of ethics of war is that it is the idea that a war should only be initiated according to some rules. Only after peace efforts have failed and when the government has declared war publicly, the cause has to be just and be declared by a lawful authority, it is required for the countries to establish a just peace when the war ends.<br>One takeaway from this article that is not related to its content is to start approaching strategies on how to deal with an article, understanding its points, gathering the main information and interpreting it.<br></p>
